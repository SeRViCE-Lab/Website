<h2>Brief Bio</h2>

<h3>General</h3>
<p>Dr. Jake VanderPlas is the Director of Research in Physical Sciences at the University of Washington's eScience Institute, an interdisciplinary program designed to support data-driven discovery in a wide range of scientific fields. His own research is in astronomy, astrophysics, machine learning, and scalable computation. Previously, VanderPlas was an NSF post-doctoral fellow working jointly between the Astronomy and Computer Science departments at the University of Washington. The thesis topic of his PhD (University of Washington, 2012) concerned <i>weak gravitational lensing</i>, a technique that uses small gravitational perturbations of light paths to learn about the distribution of matter in the universe. VanderPlas works to encourage reproducible and open research practices across scientific disciplines, and to this end develops open-source scientific computing tools and often presents tutorials on scientific computing, primarily in the Python programming language.
