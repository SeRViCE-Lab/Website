<h4><font color="#711E0C">Deep BOO: Automating Beam Orientation Optimization in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. Part I: Methodologies.</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#110D0C">Finding the optimal beam angle set from a robot's tool frame from which to aim radiation to cancer tumor(s) whilst simultaneously minimizing radiation intensity to organs-at-risks during intensity modulated radiation therapy is an exhaustive combinatorial search/human-based parameters-tuning process. So far, traditional optimization approaches for solving this problem have not yielded real-time feasible results. Aiming to automate the selection process, we introduce novel techniques from (i) pattern recognition, (ii) monte carlo evaluations, (iii) game theory, and (iv)  neuro-dynamic programming. This is so as to find admissible policies for beamlets selection duringh IMRT treatment planning. In this sentiment, we optimize a deep neural network policy which guides monte carlo simulations and evaluations of promising beamlets within the robot gantry's phase space. Our goal is not to exclusively find the minimum of an objective as traditional approaches try to do, but rather to go uphill every so often so as to arrive at a pair of saddle point equilibrium strategy for the system. We let  two fictitious neural network players,  within a zero-sum markov game framework  alternatingly play a best response to their opponent's mixed strategy profile during epsidoes of a markov decision process. At inference time, we run the trained policy on test patients' target volumes to predict feasible beam angles. This part of our paper describes the problem and formally introduces our approach. The implementation  details and results are presented in the addendum to this paper~\cite{Ogunmolu2018b}.

<h4><font color="#711E0C">Deep BOO: Automating Beam Orientation Optimization in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy. Part II: Initial Results.</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#110D0C"> This paper is the addendum to the two-part paper on automating the beam orientation optimization in intensity modulated radiotherapy treatment planning systems~\cite{Ogunmolu2018a}. The first part presented our methods and formulation using neuro-dynamic programming and monte carlo tree search. In this follow-up paper, we present numerical experiments on the result of training the neural network dynamical system and policy for anonymized prostate cases using select coplanar beams. The results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal and provides a time-efficient alternative to manually tuning robot gantry angles by dosimetrists in beam orientation optimization scenarios in clinics.

<h4><font color="#711E0C">
Automating Beam Orientation Optimization during IMRT Cancer Treatment Planning: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach).</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#110D0C">This work focuses on automating beam orientation optimization (BOO) during IMRT treatment planning. Being a nonconvex problem, we develop a hybrid approach â€“ combining techniques from deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and fluence map optimization (FMO), to find beam orientations that yield satisfactory local minima, in terms of IMRT treatment plan quality.

<h4><font color="#711E0C">Minimax Iterative Dynamic Game : Application to Nonlinear Robot Control Tasks.</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#110D0C">Multistage decision policies provide useful control strategies in high-dimensional state spaces, particularly in complex control tasks.  However, they exhibit weak performance guarantees in the presence of disturbance, model mismatch, or model uncertainties. This brittleness limits their use in high-risk scenarios. We present how to quantify the sensitivity of such policies  in order to inform of their robustness capacity. We also propose  a minimax iterative dynamic game framework for designing robust policies in the presence of disturbance/uncertainties. We test the quantification hypothesis on a carefully designed deep neural network policy; we then pose a minimax iterative dynamic game (iDG) framework for improving policy robustness in the presence of adversarial disturbances. We evaluate our iDG framework on a mecanum-wheeled robot, whose goal is to find a ocally robust optimal multistage policy that achieve a given goal-reaching task. The algorithm is simple and adaptable for designing meta-learning/deep policies that are robust against disturbances, model mismatch, or model uncertainties, up to a disturbance bound.

<h4><font color="#711E0C">Soft-NeuroAdapt: A 3-DOF neuro-adaptive patient pose correction system for frameless and maskless cancer radiotherapy.</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#110D0C">Precise patient positioning is fundamental to successful removal of malignant tumors during treatment of head and neck cancers. Errors in patient positioning have been known to damage critical organs and cause complications. To better address issues of patient positioning and motion, we introduce a 3-DOF neuro-adaptive soft-robot, called Soft-NeuroAdapt to correct deviations along 3 axes. The robot consists of inflatable air bladders that adaptively control head deviations from target while ensuring patient safety and comfort. The adaptive-neuro controller combines a state feedback component, a feedforward regulator, and a neural network that ensures correct adaptation. States are measured by a 3D vision system. We validate Soft-NeuroAdapt on a 3D printed head-and-neck dummy, and demonstrate that the controller provides adaptive actuation that compensates for intrafractional deviations in patient positioning.
