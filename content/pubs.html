      PhD Thesis: A Multi-DOF Soft Robot Mechanism for Patient Motion Correction and

</h4>
    <p><font color="#110D0C">
        Accurate patient immobilization in conformal radiation therapy is crucial for  efficient cancer treatment.
        Good treatment outcomes require accurate patient immobilization and a good choice of beam orientations.
        State-of-the-art immobilization systems rely on metallic or rigid masks which lack morphological properties,
        attenuate ionizing radiation, degrade dose efficacy, and are uncomfortable for the patient during treatment.
        The de-facto open-loop and deferred positioning procedures sometimes cause eczema or brain damage. We
        synthesize system identification, finite elastic deformation, and control systems to harness soft robot mechanisms
        for real-time motion correction in cancer radiation therapy scenarios.<br>
        Additionally, in most inverse treatment planning schemes today, the "right" beam angles among the myriad possibilities
        in beam space are usually determined  through intuition and experience by treatment planners  in a time-consuming
        trial-and-error procedure. Existing mathematical optimization techniques fail to meet a (near) real-time planning requirement.
        We propose a supervised pre-training of a deep neural network to assure quality beam plans are predicted in a real-time feasible manner. Our approach has the advantage of predicting feasible beam angles in near real time, and it is adaptable to treatment modalities that require large beam plans  and $4\pi$-noncoplanar radiation therapy such as VMAT.

  <h4><font color="#711E0C">
          A Fast Deep Learning Approach for Beam Orientation Selection Using Supervised Learning with Column Generation on IMRT Prostate Cancer Patients
      </font></h4>
      <p><font color="#110D0C">
          We propose a fast beam orientation selection method, based on deep neural networks (DNN), capable of developing a plan comparable to those by the state-of-the-art column generation method. The novelty of Our model lies in its supervised learning structure, the DNN architecture, and ability to learn from anatomical features to predict dosimetrically suitable beam orientations without using the dosimetric information from the candidate beams, a time consuming and computationally expensive process. This may save hours of computation. A supervised DNN is trained to mimic the column generation algorithm, which iteratively chooses beam orientations by calculating beam fitness values based on the KKT optimality conditions. The dataset contains 70 prostate cancer patients. The DNN trained over 400 epochs, each with 2500 steps, using the Adam optimizer and a 6-fold cross-validation technique. The average and standard deviation of training, validation, and testing loss functions among the 6-folds were at most 1.44%. The differences in the dose coverage of PTV between plans generated by column generation and by DNN were 0.2%. The average dose differences received by organs at risk were between 1 and 6 percent: bladder had the smallest average difference, then rectum, left and right femoral heads. The dose received by body had an average difference of 0.1%. In the training phase of the proposed method, the model learns the suitable beam orientations based on the anatomical features of patients and omits time intensive calculations of dose influence matrices for all possible candidate beams. Solving the Fluence Map Optimization to get the final treatment plan requires calculating dose influence matrices only for the selected beams. The proposed DNN is a fast beam orientation selection method based that selects beam orientations in seconds and is therefore suitable for clinical routines.

  Deep Learning Neural Network for Beam Orientation Optimization
  </font></h4>
    <p>
      <font color="#110D0C">
        In intensity modulated radiation therapy, the optimal choice of beam orientations has a significant impact
on the treatment plan quality, influencing the final treatment outcome. In current treatment planning
workflow, the beam direction selection is manually done by the planner, typically yielding suboptimal
solutions. Beam Orientation Optimization (BOO) methods are used to find the optimal beam directions.
Conventional BOO methods need to previously compute the dose influence matrices (Dij) for multiple
beam orientations (around 100-200 to cover all potential beam angles), and use them to perform Fluence
Map Optimization (FMO). However, both the computation of Dij matrices and FMO are very complex
and time intensive operations (can be several hours for all BOO candidate beams), which hampers their
implementations in clinical routine. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) is an attractive tool for solving
BOO problems, given its superior speed and promising results for medical applications. This work aims to
develop a fast BOO method based on deep neural networks that provides a solution in about a second, and
therefore, can be implemented in clinical routine.

  Deep BOO! Automating Beam Orientation Optimization in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy.
  </font></h4>
    <p>
      <font color="#110D0C">
        Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is a method for treating cancers by aiming radiation to cancer tumor(s) while minimizing radiation to organs-at-risk from a robot's tool frame. Computationally finding the correct treatment plan for a target volume is often an exhaustive combinatorial search problem where traditional optimization methods have not yielded real-time feasible results. Aiming to automate the beam orientation and intensity modulation process, we introduce a novel set of techniques leveraging (i) pattern recognition, (ii) monte carlo evaluations, (iii) game theory, and (iv)  neuro-dynamic programming. We optimize a deep neural network policy that guides Monte Carlo simulations of promising beamlets.
        Seeking a saddle equilibrium, we let  two fictitious neural network players,  within a zero-sum markov game framework, alternatingly play a best response to their opponent's mixed strategy profile during episodes of a two-player markov decision game. During inference, the optimized policy predicts feasible beam angles on test target volumes. This work merges the beam orientation and fluence map optimization subproblems in IMRT sequential treatment planning system into one pipeline. We formally introduce our approach, and present numerical results for coplanar beam angles on prostate cases.

Automating Beam Orientation Optimization during IMRT Cancer Treatment Planning: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach.</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#110D0C">This work focuses on automating beam orientation optimization (BOO) during IMRT treatment planning. Being a nonconvex problem, we develop a hybrid approach – combining techniques from deep reinforcement learning (DRL), and fluence map optimization (FMO), to find beam orientations that yield satisfactory local minima, in terms of IMRT treatment plan quality.

<h4><font color="#711E0C">Minimax Iterative Dynamic Game : Application to Nonlinear Robot Control Tasks.</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#110D0C">Multistage decision policies provide useful control strategies in high-dimensional state spaces, particularly in complex control tasks.  However, they exhibit weak performance guarantees in the presence of disturbance, model mismatch, or model uncertainties. This brittleness limits their use in high-risk scenarios. We present how to quantify the sensitivity of such policies  in order to inform of their robustness capacity. We also propose  a minimax iterative dynamic game framework for designing robust policies in the presence of disturbance/uncertainties. We test the quantification hypothesis on a carefully designed deep neural network policy; we then pose a minimax iterative dynamic game (iDG) framework for improving policy robustness in the presence of adversarial disturbances. We evaluate our iDG framework on a mecanum-wheeled robot, whose goal is to find a ocally robust optimal multistage policy that achieve a given goal-reaching task. The algorithm is simple and adaptable for designing meta-learning/deep policies that are robust against disturbances, model mismatch, or model uncertainties, up to a disturbance bound.

Errors in patient positioning have been known to damage critical organs and cause complications. To better address issues of patient positioning and motion, we introduce a 3-DOF neuro-adaptive soft-robot, called Soft-NeuroAdapt to correct deviations along 3 axes. The robot consists of inflatable air bladders that adaptively control head deviations from target while ensuring patient safety and comfort. The adaptive-neuro controller combines a state feedback component, a feedforward regulator, and a neural network that ensures correct adaptation. States are measured by a 3D vision system. We validate Soft-NeuroAdapt on a 3D printed head-and-neck dummy, and demonstrate that the controller provides adaptive actuation that compensates for intrafractional deviations in patient positioning.

  <h4><font color="#711E0C">An Image-Guided Soft Robotic Patient Positioning System for Maskless Head-And-Neck Cancer Radiotherapy: A Proof-Of-Concept Study.</font></h4>
      <p><font color="#110D0C"> Use of inflatable air bladders in controlling the flexion/extension cranial motion of a simulated patient during maskless cancer radiotherapy. We imitate IGRT by using RGB-D depth sensors to generate surface images of a patient and extract the pose information from the reconstructed mesh. Results show that the system is capable of controlling head motion to within 2mm with respect to a reference trajectory. </font> <br>

using machine vision.</font></h4>
    <p><font color="#110D0C"> Flying of the ACSE dept quadrotor using extracted image features from a structured indoor environment. We apply invariant moments, extract corners from UAV camera frames and
    compare results with calibrated helipad image; we learn actual helipad features by computing matching variance and then estimate the UAV pose in a hovering condition to plan landing.
